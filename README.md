# Flutter Stateless and Stateful Kata

A kata designed to introduce the creation of custom Widgets. It requires understanding of the difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets.

Prior knowledge requirements:
- Finding components in the [Flutter widget catalog](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets)
- `Text`, `Column` and `Row` Widgets

## Getting Started

The goal of this Kata is to reproduce below screenshot

Specs:
- UI is centered vertically
- There is 32px between the title and the counter
- The title needs to be a Stateless Widget
- The counter needs to be a Stateful Widget

Challenges:
- Make title bigger (font size 24)
- Add an optional parameter to the counter widget to start the counter at a different number than 0
